Lizard Spock JS Game. 

Initial ideas. 

Just an easy background image over the entire screen. 
Keeping the theme from my other work on HTML/CSS (found here) i decided 
to implement the same rounded borders. 

Just a big blob in the middle of the screen with all the content. 

Header Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock. 
A way to keep score. 
A promt for winner/looser/and who picked what. 
Clickable buttons for the different choices. 

That should be all. 
More to come here.

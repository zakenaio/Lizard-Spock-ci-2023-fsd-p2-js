## Features

- **Header**

    - In the header i have used a relativly new function called text-wrap: balance. 
    On big screens it makes no difference.

- **Header Mobile text-wrap**

    -In the header i have used a relativly new function called text-wrap: balance. 
    But here on mobile it make all the difference, usually the break would be after 
    Lizard, so Spock. would have been alone (orfan) but with text-wrap: balance it 
    balances the text, so we have two words on the lower line. Much prettier.
